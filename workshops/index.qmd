# Overview 

This workshop was developed for ES40: Critical Thinking and Evidence Based Reasoning at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

# Abstract

R is a programming language that enables us to turn data into understanding. In this workshop, we'll introduce the {dplyr} package of the {tidyverse}, which houses many functions that make data easier to work with, as an introduction to R and its applications for environmental data.
