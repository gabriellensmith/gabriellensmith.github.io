    "text": "The agricultural sector faces opposing pressures of sustaining a growing population while minimizing its unfavorable outcomes on finite environmental resources1. In an effort to simultaneously move towards these goals, countries around the world have prioritized agricultural productivity. One of the most informative measures of agricultural productivity is total factor productivity (TFP). TFP compares gross outputs of crop, animal and aquaculture products to inputs of land, labor, capital and material resources utilized in farm production2. As gross output increases at a faster rate than total inputs, total factor production improves, which eases tensions on environmental resources and food security, and boosts economic growth3. TFP is expressed generally by the equation: \\[TFP=Y/X\\] where Y represents gross output and X represents total inputs.\nTFP is an important measure for informing policy priorities for agricultural productivity. These policies include investments in research and development, incentivizing economic reforms for farmers, rural education and extension, and improvments in infrastructure4. Understanding the effects of individual inputs on TFP can direct decision making as it relates to resource allocation for these policy investments.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis will regress global TFP indices on inputs of land, labor, capital, and materials to examine the effects of these inputs on gross outputs. This regression can be utilized to maximize TFP growth rates by differentiating efficiency levels of individual inputs as they relate to gross productivity, which can direct resource allocation to technological improvements of inefficient input systems.\nAdditionally, it will examine TFP growth rates for country groupings of income class (defined by the World Bank) by testing for mean differences. It will also forecast TFP growth rates for years 2020-2030 at a global scale and for income classes by employing automated autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) models. Understanding nuances in TFP growth for varying income scales can be useful in further research to refine regressions that direct policy prioritization.\nAll relevant analysis outputs are included in the Analysis section - for detailed code concerning model checking, reference the Model Testing and Supporting Figures section."

    "text": "I grew up in San Diego, California. I moved to Santa Barbara in 2018 to pursue a Bachelor’s of Science in Statistics and Data Science. During that time, I experimented, a lot, with different educational enthusiasms.\nThroughout my life, I have always had a passion for people and the world around us. This passion turned into a career aspiration after a transformative volunteer trip to Thailand with GIVE Volunteers in 2019.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA couple of friends that I made during my time in Thailand!\n\nDuring my two week experience abroad, I had the opportunity to establish a functional permaculture agricultural system in a remote village in Mueang Kong. For context, permaculture is a holistic design philosophy that promotes sustainable and regenerative farming practices. It strives to maximize productivity while minimizing negative environmental impacts by emulating natural patterns and processes. To learn more about permaculture in agriculture, you can find additional information here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was fascinated by this pursuit of harmony between people and the natural world, and it has since become the driving force behind both my personal and professional goals. Inspired by this experience, I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Environmental Data Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. This choice allowed me to merge my educational background with my aspiration to contribute to systems that promote the well-being of both people and the planet.\nSince then, I have honed a diverse skill set in data science, equipping me with the tools to employ data-driven decision making in addressing environmental challenges in a sustainable and equitable way. My aim is to apply these skills in future career endeavors, working towards a better world that cares for the health of all living beings."
