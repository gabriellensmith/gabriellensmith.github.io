# **Welcome!**

I'm Gabrielle, and I am a recent graduate of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara with a Master's in Environmental Data Science. I also earned a Statistics and Data Science B.S. from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2022.

I'm passionate about leveraging remote sensing techniques to address our environmental challenges and climate issues. If you're curious about some of the projects I've worked on, you came to the right place!
