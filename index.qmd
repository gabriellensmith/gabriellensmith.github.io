## **Welcome!**

I'm Gabrielle! I'm a geospatial data engineer with a background in environmental data sceince, driven by a passion for applying data and technology to address climate and sustainability challenges. At Climate Engine, I leveraged geospatial analysis to support climate resilience efforts a variety of applications including water, wildfire, extreme weather, and biodiversity. Prior to that, I earned a Master's of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I focused on the intersection of data science and environmental problem-solving. I'm eager to continue using my skills to create impactful, equitable solutions for a changing planet.
