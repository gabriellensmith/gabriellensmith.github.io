I grew up in San Diego, California. I moved to Santa Barbara in 2018 to pursue a Bachelor's of Science in Statistics and Data Science. During that time, I experimented, *a lot*, with different educational enthusiasms.

Throughout my life, I have always had a passion for people and the world around us. This passion turned into a career aspiration after a transformative volunteer trip to Thailand with [GIVE Volunteers](https://www.givevolunteers.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwhJukBhBPEiwAniIcNeMOJ2LlIRyV0-YOr1akd9kVzUru9RmLmzuXNa2iJZ9JHaB3HlmgVxoCOx8QAvD_BwE) in 2019.

During my two week experience abroad, I had the opportunity to establish a functional permaculture agricultural system in a remote village in Mueang Kong. For context, permaculture is a holistic design philosophy that promotes sustainable and regenerative farming practices. It strives to maximize productivity while minimizing negative environmental impacts by emulating natural patterns and processes. To learn more about permaculture in agriculture, you can find additional information [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8606280/).

I was fascinated by this pursuit of harmony between people and the natural world, and it has since become the driving force behind both my personal and professional goals. Inspired by this experience, I decided to pursue a Master's degree in Environmental Data Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara. This choice allowed me to merge my educational background with my aspiration to contribute to systems that promote the well-being of both people and the planet.

Since then, I have honed a diverse skill set in data science, equipping me with the tools to employ data-driven decision making in addressing environmental challenges in a sustainable and equitable way. My aim is to apply these skills in future career endeavors, working towards a better world that cares for the health of all living beings.
