I grew up in San Diego, California. I moved to Santa Barbara in 2018 to pursue a Bachelor's of Science in Statistics and Data Science. I spent those years exploring a variety of interests - curious about how data, people, and the environment intersect in meaningful ways.

A pivotal moment for me came in 2019 during a volunteer trip to a rural village in Thailand. While there, I helped implement a permaculture system designed to promote long-term sustainability. That experience sparked a deeper committment to environmental stewardship and inspired me to align my career with work that supports both people and the planet.

Inspried by that journey, I returned to UCSB to earn my Master's in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management. It gave me the foundation to bridge technical skill with mission-driven work.

From 2023 to 2025, I worked as a Geospatial Data Engineer at Climate Engine, where I built and maintained scalable workflows to process environmental data across spatial and temporal dimensions. My work supported projects focused on wildfire, flooding, extreme events, and biodiversity - using tools like Python, BigQuery, and containerized environments to make large-scale geospatial data actionable.

I'm continuing to seek out meaningful ways to apply data science in service of sustainability, equity, and resilience - whether through building geospatial tools, developing scalable data infrastructure for climate applications, or exploring new technical paths that support environmental and social impact.
